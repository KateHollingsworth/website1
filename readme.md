This is beer

I see you have this line as well, well Ill tell a short story then. My 'first beer' was in Ocean City with my dad and his best friend named Bill who is a man who visually is the perfect blend of actual cowboy and 80's rockstar. I had my first 'beer' at 8am-- it was a budlight in a can. I fell out of my bed laughing over it. Bill was drunk by 11, I was pacing, while my dad started up a 72 Chevelle and he drove us up and down coastal highway. It was the best 21st Birthday. -ns
